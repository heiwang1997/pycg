`video` module provides a nice set of parameters that use state-of-the-art x264 technology to compress your video without losing quality.
The parameter is found by Maruto-toolbox designed for bilibili.

- `video.make_video_xw264` takes either a folder (containing png sequences), or a mp4 file as input, the user could choose `fps`, or `crf`.
